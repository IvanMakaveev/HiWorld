# HiWorld

## ðŸ“ƒ Project Description
**HiWorld** is a web application which provides a lot of the functionality of the biggest modern social networks like Facebook, Twitter and others.
It is separated into the following controllers:

**Home** - provides the basic functionality used by the users. It consists of a _Welcome Page_, _Privacy Policy_, _Browse Page_ and a _Search Page_. The **Browse Page** presents all of the newest posts from people and pages you follow. The **Search Page** allows you to find new friends, pages or posts by typing in keywords into the search bar.

**Profiles**, **Posts** and **Pages** - everything related to profile and page management and post creation. Those three provide the ability of creating, editing and browsing different pages and profiles. They allow users to follow others who they find interesting and see their newest posts on their _Home/Browse_ page. Posts can be created by both Profiles and Pages. They can contain an image and tags (but it is not neccessary). Pages can be created by users to represent a brand, organisation or different individuals without their identity being shown. They can only have followers and can also contain different tags so they can be found easily.

**Tags** - allows users to mark what their _Posts_ or _Pages_ are about and the topics discussed in them. By clicking on a _Tag_ you can search for other Pages and Posts.

**Friends** - there you can see all your friends and manage them. It consists of a page for accepted friend requests and pending friend requests. Friends are an important part of every social network and in this one they allow you to create _Chat Groups_ for real time chatting.

**Groups** - contain all the functionality revolving around creating and managing a chat group. You can _Create_, _Edit_, _Add Friends_, _Change their permission level_ and more. You can only invite people who have added you as a _Friend_.
